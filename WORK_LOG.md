We discussed both top-down and bottom-up approaches to do this. I also though about doing it recursively, but it seems very slow without any speedups. |
| Jan 28 | 10:50 - 11:50  | Started working a bit on coding my recursive idea of going from the bottom and adding coins and then a the end checking on if they target is reached and then incrementing the count. Also discussed other ideas in class like splitting it into smaller numbers and then solving step by step to limit function calls.  |
