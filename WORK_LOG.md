| Jan 24 | 12:45 - 1:45pm |                                                                                                            Thought about ways to approach this problem with the people in my class. We discussed both top-down and bottom-up approaches to do this. I also though about doing it recursively, but it seems very slow without any speedups. |
| Jan 28 | 10:50 - 11:50  |                    Started working a bit on coding my recursive idea of going from the bottom and adding coins and then a the end checking on if they target is reached and then incrementing the count. Also discussed other ideas in class like splitting it into smaller numbers and then solving step by step to limit function calls. |
| Jan 30 |  5:10 - 5:40   |                                                                    I implemented a recursive function that starts from the bottom and adds coins while checking if the target is reached. The function explores both including and excluding a coin at each step I have not yet optimized it but it follows the logic I described earlier. |
| Feb 9  |  2:30 - 3:00   |                                                        Continued on working on solving the memoization approach to the problem which I had in my first attempt and worked a bit on in the last class period. Was getting indexoutofbounds, but solved it by presetting every array value to -1 that way I knew that it wasn't seen before. |
| Feb 9  |  3:00 - 3:30   | Worked on solving it using tabulation. I created the 2-D array tabulation table to keep track of our results that we are building up. I iteratively filled the array starting from the smallest amount and coin. I calculated how many ways each amount can be made considering if the coin is used or not. I return the final array cell. |
| Feb 9  |  7:50 - 8:20   |     Create a 1D array to store the number of ways to make each amount. Set 0 to 1 as their is only one way to make it. Then iterated through each coin and updated the dynamic array by adding the amount of ways we could make i - that coin to the amount of ways to make i. In the end returned how many ways their are to make target. |
