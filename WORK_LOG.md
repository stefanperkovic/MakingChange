We discussed both top-down and bottom-up approaches to do this. I also though about doing it recursively, but it seems very slow without any speedups. |
| Jan 28 | 10:50 - 11:50  | Started working a bit on coding my recursive idea of going from the bottom and adding coins and then a the end checking on if they target is reached and then incrementing the count. Also discussed other ideas in class like splitting it into smaller numbers and then solving step by step to limit function calls. |
| Jan 30 |  5:10 - 5:40   |                                                 I implemented a recursive function that starts from the bottom and adds coins while checking if the target is reached. The function explores both including and excluding a coin at each step I have not yet optimized it but it follows the logic I described earlier. |
